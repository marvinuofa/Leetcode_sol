## Problems Solved

### 1. **Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros** (LeetCode 2918)
   - **Languages**: Python
   - **Description**: This problem involves finding the minimum equal sum of two arrays after replacing zeros in both arrays.
   - **Solution Approach**: The solution focuses on finding the optimal replacement values for zeros in the arrays to achieve a minimum equal sum.
   - **Folder**: `algorithms/`

### 2. **Three Consecutive Odds** (LeetCode 1550)
   - **Languages**: Python, C
   - **Description**: This problem asks whether there are three consecutive odd numbers in an array.
